This will be my first time trying WPF and making with it a password manager that saves loaclly. The plan currently is (04.17) to able to save 5 passwords at one time. Later I wanna make that the user can create and save unlimited passwords. This application won't be secure from the start, but I'll porbably want make it secure when I finished the basic version. So DON'T USE IT YET!
